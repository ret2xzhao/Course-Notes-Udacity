1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
The goal of trajectory generation is to

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,755
generate a trajectory defined by a series of way points.

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,785
We assign a time stamp,

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,030
and a velocity to each way point,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,595
and we can fit a curve to these way points to create

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,895
a geometric representation of the trajectory.

7
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:22,185
Since moving obstacles may block parts of the road temporarily,

8
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:25,545
each way point in the trajectory has a timestamp.

9
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:30,540
We can combine the timestamp with the outputs of the prediction module to verify

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,760
that each way point on the trajectory will be

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,075
vacant at the time we plan to move through it.

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,405
These timestamps create a three-dimensional trajectory with

13
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:45,810
each way point defined by two dimensions and space plus a third dimension in time.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,525
We also designate a velocity for each way point.

15
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:55,190
The velocities ensure that the vehicle reaches each way point on schedule.
