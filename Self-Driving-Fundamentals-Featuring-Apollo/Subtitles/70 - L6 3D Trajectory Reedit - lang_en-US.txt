1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,480
The goal of trajectory generation is to

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,260
generate a trajectory defined by a series of waypoints.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,800
We assign a timestamp and a velocity to each waypoint.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,120
And we can fit a curve to these waypoints

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,360
to create a geometric representation of the trajectory.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,020
Since moving obstacles may block parts of the road temporarily,

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,020
each waypoint in the trajectory has a timestamp.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,740
We can combine the timestamp with the outputs of the prediction module

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,340
to verify that each waypoint on the trajectory will be vacant

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,380
at the time we plan to move through it.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,880
These timestamps create a three-dimensional trajectory,

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,160
with each waypoint defined by two dimensions in space,

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,220
plus a third dimension in time.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,040
We also designate a velocity for each waypoint.

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,140
The velocities ensures that the vehicle reaches each waypoint on schedule.
