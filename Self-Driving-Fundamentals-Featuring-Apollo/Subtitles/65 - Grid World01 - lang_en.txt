A star is a classic algorithm to handle path finding.

2
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:09,570
Let's demonstrate how A star works using a grid world.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,320
We take each cell in this world is a node we're able

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,055
to move from any one node to any of its adjacent nodes.

5
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:22,540
This particular world include some walls that block potential paths.
