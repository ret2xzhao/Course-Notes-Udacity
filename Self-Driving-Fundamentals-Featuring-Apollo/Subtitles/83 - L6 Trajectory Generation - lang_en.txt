1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,724
Once we have both the ST and SL trajectories,

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,070
we need to transform them back to the Cartesian coordinate frame.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,434
Then we can combine them to construct a three-dimensional trajectory

4
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:18,129
composed of two-dimensional way points and one-dimensional time stamps.

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:23,049
The ST trajectory is the longitudinal displacement over time,

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,820
and the SL trajectory is

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,839
the lateral offset for each point on the longitudinal trajectory.

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,229
Since both trajectories have a longitudinal coordinate S,

9
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:38,250
we can combine the trajectories by matching them on their S values.
