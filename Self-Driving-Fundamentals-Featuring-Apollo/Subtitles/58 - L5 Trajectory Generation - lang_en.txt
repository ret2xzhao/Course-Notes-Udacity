1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,245
Trajectory generation is the final step of prediction.

2
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:07,429
Once we predict the lane sequence of an object,

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:10,195
then we predict the object's trajectory.

4
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:12,675
Between any two points, A and B,

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,480
there are infinite candidate trajectories for an object to travel.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,649
How do we predict the most likely trajectory?

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,529
We can start by setting constraints that will

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,390
eliminate most of the candidate trajectories.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,824
First, we make an assumption that the car will align with the center of the target lane.

10
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,780
We continue by discarding trajectories which are

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,285
impossible to be physically executed by the vehicle.

12
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:40,649
We select from among the remaining trajectories by

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,600
considering the vehicle's current velocity and acceleration.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,179
In practice, we don't actually list all of

15
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,454
the possible trajectories and eliminate them one-by-one.

16
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:54,719
Rather, we apply this idea mathematically.

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,204
Notice the position and heading of the vehicle at both points.

18
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:04,784
These two poses represent the initial state and the final state of a motion model.

19
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:09,310
We can fit a polynomial model using these two conditions.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,100
In most cases, this kind of polynomial model is good enough for prediction.
