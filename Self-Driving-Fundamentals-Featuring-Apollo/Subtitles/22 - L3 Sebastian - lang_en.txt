00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,810
Let's dive into localization.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,620
A topic that's very close to my heart.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,019
Back in the day when I was a full-time professor at

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,250
Stanford I published probably over 100 papers on localization,

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,620
so I can talk about it forever.

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,109
What is localization? Well, a robot needs to know where it is and this is not just the X,

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,609
Y locations also the heading direction and so on.

8
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,679
You might think that the GPS system that we have in space is good enough,

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,870
is good enough for you and me to navigate a car,

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,140
but what we're going to pursue with precision localization.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,505
We're going to be so accurate that we can tell exactly in which land we are,

12
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:39,000
and where inside the lane we are. Why is that good?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,494
Because if we know exactly where we are,

14
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:46,429
we can almost drive blindly if it wasn't for other cars and pedestrians and so on.

15
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,174
So, we're going to do a big panoramic view on localization.

16
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:52,140
Thereâ€˜s different type of sensors involved,

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,600
we have what's called the inertial sensing,

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
there's different type of external sensors involve cameras,

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,679
lighter, all these wonderful things you've heard about in the news.

20
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,810
So, let's dive in and look at the topic of localization.
