1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,220
We'll perform SL planning based on an assumption that

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,780
the car should steadily align with the central line of the lane

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,340
no matter what ending state it would enter.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,740
This means we only need to sample lateral ending positions within a small area.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,480
Specifically,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,920
we sample positions around the center lines of adjacent lanes on the road.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,380
To ensure stability,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,680
the ending state for the cars heading should align with the center of the lane.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,220
When we plot the lateral position against the longitudinal position,

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,780
the candidate trajectory we want

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,940
should end with the vehicle aligned with the lane and driving straight.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,080
In order to achieve this ending state,

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,040
the first-order and second-order derivatives of heading and position

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,420
should both be zero.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,840
This means the vehicle is neither moving laterally,

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,760
that’s the first-order derivative,

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,540
nor accelerating laterally, that’s the second-order derivative.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,160
The vehicle is just travelling straight down the lane.
